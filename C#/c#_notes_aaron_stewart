C# - 

	Whereas C is a low-level programming language, and C++ is a low-level language that adds object-oriented features to C,
	C# is a high-level programming language.

	As a part of the "C" family of programming languages, it inherets much of its structure from its lower-level counterparts.

	One such inherited feature is its object-oriented nature. C# has objects and "classes," of which multiple "instances" can
	be created. These classes can contain certain attributes, variables, and functions that belong to them.

	For instance, the "Rectangle" class could have the variables "side_length_a", "side_length_b", "side_length_c", and "side_length_d",
	and it could contain the method "sum_side_lengths(a, b, c, d)". 

	Multiple "instances" of the Rectangle class could then be created, each with their own side lengths, generally using a constructor.
	A constructor is a function that is called to create an instance of an object or class.

	So, to create an instance of a rectangle, it might look something like this:
	
	rectangle_a = create_rectangle(12,12,6,6);
