React -

	React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

	React can be installed using the following command:

		npm install react react-dom webpack

	However, installing via this approach requires significant configuration. An alternative and easier installation method can be evoked using this command:

		npx create-react-app my-app

	JSX - One of the key features of React, JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows for HTML-style code to be used
	      within .js files to update specific sections of the application's DOM (Document Object Model), thereby providing 
	      users with a means of dynamically updating the appplication's UI that is both simpler and more resource-efficient
	      than making HTML modifications that would require a full DOM reload.
